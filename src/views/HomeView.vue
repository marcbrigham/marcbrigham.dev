      <p class="grey-text">As you can probably tell by taking one glance at my work, I am incredibly passionate about sports and the creative process. I believe that sports have this secret superpower to bring us all together, regardless of who we are or where we come from. Being able to create content and experiences for people in this space for a living is something that I truly love.<br><br>I've built my portfolio website by coding using HTML/CSS, and I designed a different user experience for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewers.<strong></strong><br></p>
